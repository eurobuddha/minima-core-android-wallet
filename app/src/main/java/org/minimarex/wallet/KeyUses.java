/**
 * KeyUses — the durable one-time-signature (WOTS) uses counter.
 *
 * <p><b>Why this exists.</b> Each Minima {@link org.minima.objects.keys.TreeKey} leaf is a
 * Winternitz one-time key. Signing <i>twice</i> at the same {@code uses} index leaks enough of the
 * private key material to forge signatures — i.e. it lets an attacker steal the funds guarded by
 * that key. Preventing a reuse is the single most important correctness/security requirement of the
 * whole wallet.
 *
 * <p><b>THE SAFETY CONTRACT (must hold for every implementation):</b>
 * <ol>
 *   <li><b>Reserve-before-sign.</b> {@link #reserveNextUse(int)} MUST durably persist
 *       {@code uses := n+1} (a committed / fsynced write, not an async one) <i>before</i> it
 *       returns the leaf index {@code n} to be signed. A caller obtains {@code n} ONLY through this
 *       method, and only after the +1 is already on disk. A crash between the persist and the
 *       actual signature therefore <i>skips</i> leaf {@code n} (harmless — a wasted leaf) and can
 *       never cause the same leaf to be handed out twice. Never sign-then-persist.</li>
 *   <li><b>Read = MAX across all sources.</b> {@link #currentUses(int)} returns the MAXIMUM value
 *       seen across every available source (local mirrors, a restored backup, a future chain
 *       probe). Signing <i>below</i> the true count is the only dangerous direction, so a higher
 *       value must always win; a partial or stale source can raise the counter but never lower it.
 *       {@link #recordExternalUses(int, int)} folds an externally-learned count in under the same
 *       MAX rule.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>The API is deliberately shaped so a signature <i>cannot</i> be produced without first advancing
 * the counter: {@link WalletCore#signTransactionID} calls {@link #reserveNextUse(int)} and signs the
 * leaf it returns. There is no method that yields a leaf index without persisting the advance.
 *
 * <p>M0 note: a {@link PrefsKeyUses SharedPreferences}-backed implementation is sufficient for this
 * milestone. Seed-derived encryption of this store and its portable/manual backup are M3.
